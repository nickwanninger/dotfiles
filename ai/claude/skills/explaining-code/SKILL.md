description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks "how does this work?"
---

When explaining code, always include:

1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life
2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
3. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?

If it has complicated control flow or confusing structure, include a walkthrough of the code.

Don't use emojis, and don't be afraid to include deep technical details
